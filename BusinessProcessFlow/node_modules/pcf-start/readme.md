## Overview

This package contains the scripts required to test and debug a custom PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) control for Microsoft PowerApps on your local development PC.
The scripts are designed to be used in conjunction with the Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool, which is separately available via an MSI installer.

Please visit the publicly available [documentation for the Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/create-custom-controls-using-pcf) to learn more.
You can also install the PowerApps CLI via its [MSI installer](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).

**Without Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool this package should only be used for reference purposes.**
